### Single Responsibility Principle

### Open Closed Principle
    open for extension but closed for modification (onion wrapper make the logics more nested and the core function is getting tighter and tighter and difficult and scary to edit)

### Liskov Substitution Principle

### Don't Repeat Yourself

## Design Patterns

### Prototype Design Pattern
    The object have the capability of making a fresh object

### Builder Design Pattern
